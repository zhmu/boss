BOSS is my attempt at creating a boot manager solution. You can still find
ancient versions around various FTP archives, it is the very first piece of
code I dared to release on the Internet back in 1998.

This file contains all versions ever released; including full source code.
Originally, you had to mail me if you wanted the source and I'd mail it back;
this was mainly to prevent kiddo's ripping code (Trust me, I have seen this
happen). However, as the times have changed, so have I and here it is :)

I'm releasing this in the public domain. Enjoy!

# Better Operating System Selector (BOSS)

BOSS, or _Better Operating System Selector_, is the bootmanager I coded back in 1998. It was the first piece of code I released over the internet.

 You can find more information in the [readme.txt](releases/readme.txt) file. Simtel and mirrors have ancient versions of this program, this repository includes all releases including sources when available. Note that the installer/setup tool is maybe the first serious C/C++ code I ever wrote, so don't let it scare you. I've learned a lot since then :-)
